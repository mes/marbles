\subsection{IsaViz}

IsaViz \cite{isaviz} already implements a rendering engine that can interpret GSS style\-sheets \cite{Pietriga03} for styling RDF models represented as node-link diagrams. The new version (currently under development) features two presentation paradigms that both support Fresnel stylesheets: the default paradigm based on node-link diagrams, and a new paradigm based on the box model described in section \ref{fsStyle} which will take advantage of the zoomable user interface and semantic zooming capabilities associated with the graphical toolkit upon which the user interface is built \cite{Pietriga05a}.

@@@ Mention alternate interpretation in the Semantic ZUI representation
