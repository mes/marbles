\subsection{Other Implementations}

Another effort to implement Fresnel is the Arago RDF-browser. Arago is currently being developed at DERI and renders XHTML representations of RDF data\cite{Gassert05}. Another groups that are currently in the process of evaluating Fresnel and migh support it in their tools are the Haystack team at MIT\cite{Quan04} and the Noadster team at CWI\cite{Rutledge05}.
