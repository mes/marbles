\section{Fresnel Implementations}
\label{impl}

{\em Note to the reviewers: Fresnel is currently being implemented by several RDF visualization tools and there are further groups that are currently evaluating it and might descide to support Fresnel within their tools. This section reflects the current status of Fresnel implementations. We expect to update this section in the camera-ready version of this paper.}

Fresnel represents RDF display knowledge in an abstract and declarative manner. It provides high-level indications about how the data should be presented, but does not impose any constraint on the output format or any particular method or representation paradigm. It is therefore up to the browsers and applications to interpret Fresnel display knowledge according to their own representation paradigm. This section gives an overview of the Fresnel implementation efforts currently being conducted by several research groups.
