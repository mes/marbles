Todo: Come back to abstraction of selection and styling as general problems: In this paper we have dicussed different approaches and abstraced to general prblems ...
Todo: In order to ... exchange of knowledge ... we provide core-ontology for ....mention why we designed fresel that way ... browser-indpendent......declarative...layout independent...

In this paper, we have presented Fresnel a browser-independent vocabulary for representing display knowledge for RDF data. We have demonstrated how Fresnel is interpreted by RDF visualization tools relying on different display paradigms and gave an overview about the Fresnel implementation effort currently conducted by several research groups. 

Todo: Maybe mention week points (editing, lens purpose)
Todo: Maybe talk about next steps.

Developing Fresnel is a community effort. We thus welcome everybody to contribute to the development of the core vocabularies, extend them with modules for special needs or support Fresnel by providing lenses and styles for their preferred vocabularies.

More information about the developments around Fresnel is found on the Fresnel website: http://www.w3.org/2004/09/fresnel-info/
