	<title>The Repository API</title>
	<para>
		The Repository API is the central access point for Sesame repositories.
		Its purpose is to give a developer-friendly access point to RDF
		repositories, offering various methods for querying and updating the
		data, while hiding a lot of the nitty gritty details of the underlying
		machinery.
	</para>
	<para>
		In this chapter, we will try to explain the basics of how to program
		against the Repository API. The interfaces for the Repository API
		can be found in package
		<classname>org.openrdf.repository</classname>.  Several
		implementations for these interface exist in various sub-packages.
		The Javadoc reference for the API is available <ulink
			url="http://www.openrdf.org/doc/sesame2/api/">online</ulink> and
		can also be found in the <filename>doc</filename> directory of the
		download.

		<title>Creating a Repository object</title>

		<para>
			The first step in any action that involves Sesame repositories
			is to create a <classname>Repository</classname> for it.
			Repository objects operate on (stacks of) Sail object(s) for
			storage and retrieval of RDF data. An important thing to
			remember is that the behaviour of a repository is determined by
			the Sail(s) that it operates on; for example, the repository
			will only support RDF Schema or OWL semantics if the Sail stack
			includes an inferencer for this.
		</para>
		<para>
			The central interface of the repository API is the
			<classname>Repository</classname> interface. There are several
			implementations available of this interface:
		</para>
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>
				<classname>org.openrdf.repository.sail.SailRepository</classname>
				is <classname>Repository</classname> that operates directly on
				top of a <classname>Sail</classname>. This is the class most
				commonly used when accessing a local Sesame repository.
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<classname>org.openrdf.repository.http.HTTPRepository</classname>
				is, as the name implies, a <classname>Repository</classname>
				implementation that acts as a proxy to a Sesame repository
				available on a remote Sesame server, accessible through
				HTTP.
			</listitem>
		</itemizedlist>
		<para>
			In the following section, we will first take a look at the use of
			the <classname>SailRepository</classname> class in order to
			create and use a local Sesame repository.
		</para>
		<section>
			<title>Creating a main memory RDF Repository</title>
			<para>
				One of the simplest configurations is a repository that just
				stores RDF data in main memory without applying any
				inferencing or whatsoever. This is also by far the fastest
				type of repository that can be used. The following code
				creates and initialize a non-inferencing main-memory
				repository:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[
import org.openrdf.repository.Repository;
import org.openrdf.repository.sail.SailRepository;
import org.openrdf.sail.memory.MemoryStore;


...

Repository myRepository = new SailRepository(new MemoryStore());
myRepository.initialize();]]></programlisting>
			<para>
				The constructor of the <classname>SailRepository</classname>
				class accepts any object of type <classname>Sail</classname>,
				so we simply pass it a new main-memory store object (which is,
				of course, a <classname>Sail</classname> implementation).
				Following this, the repository needs to be initialized to
				prepare the Sail(s) that it operates on, which includes
				operations such as restoring previously stored data, setting
				up connections to a relational database, etc.
			</para>
			<para>
				The repository that is created by the above code is
				<emphasis>volatile</emphasis>: its contents are lost when the
				object is garbage collected or when the program is shut down.
				This is fine for cases where, for example, the repository is
				used as a means for manipulating an RDF model in memory.
			</para>
			<para>
				Different types of Sail objects take parameters in their
				constructor that change their behaviour. The
				<classname>MemoryStore</classname> for example takes a data
				directory parameter that specifies a data directory for
				persisent storage. If specified, the MemoryStore will write its
				contents to this directory so that it can restore it when it is
				initialized in a future session:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[
File dataDir = new File("c:\\temp\\myRepository\\");
Repository myRepository = new SailRepository( new MemoryStore(dataDir) );
myRepository.initialize();]]></programlisting>
			<para>
				As you can see, we can fine-tune the configuration of our
				repository by passing parameters to the constructor of the
				Sail object. Some Sail types may offer additional
				configuration methods, all of which need to be called before
				the repository is initialized. The
				<classname>MemoryStore</classname> currently has one such
				method: <function>setSyncDelay(long)</function>, which can
				be used to control the strategy that is used for writing to
				the data file, e.g.:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[
File dataDir = new File("c:\\temp\\myRepository\\");
MemoryStore memStore = new MemoryStore(dataDir);
memStore.setSyncDelay(1000L);

Repository myRepository = new SailRepository(memStore);
myRepository.initialize();]]></programlisting>

		<section>
			<title>Creating a Native RDF Repository</title>
			<para>
			  A Native RDF Repository does not keep its data in main memory,
			  but instead stores it directly to disk (in a binary format
			  optimized for compact storage and fast retrieval). It is an
			  efficient, scalable and fast solution for RDF storage of
			  datasets that are too large to keep entirely in memory.
			</para>
			<para>
			  The code for creation of a Native RDF repository is almost
			  identical to that of a main memory repository:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[
import org.openrdf.repository.Repository;
import org.openrdf.repository.sail.SailRepository;
import org.openrdf.sail.nativerdf.NativeStore;


...
File dataDir = new File("/path/to/datadir/");
Repository myRepository = new SailRepository(new NativeStore(dataDir));
myRepository.initialize();]]></programlisting>
			<para>
			  By default, the Native store creates a set of two indexes (see
			  <xref linkend="section-native-store-config"/>). To
			  configure which indexes it should create, we can either use the
			  <classname>NativeStore.setTripleIndexes(String)</classname>
			  method, or we can directly supply a index configuration string
			  to the constructor:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[
import org.openrdf.repository.Repository;
import org.openrdf.repository.sail.SailRepository;
import org.openrdf.sail.nativerdf.NativeStore;


...
File dataDir = new File("/path/to/datadir/");
String indexes = "spoc,posc,cosp";
Repository myRepository = new SailRepository(new NativeStore(dataDir, indexes));
myRepository.initialize();]]></programlisting>
		</section> <!-- Creating a Native RDF Repository -->

		<section>
			<title>Creating a repository with RDF Schema inferencing</title>
			<para>
				As we have seen, we can create <classname>Repository</classname>
				objects for any kind of back-end store by passing them a
				reference to the appropriate Sail object. We can pass any
				stack of Sails this way, allowing all kinds of repository
				configurations to be created quite easily. For example, to
				stack an RDF Schema inferencer on top of a memory store,
				we simply create a repository like so:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[
import org.openrdf.repository.Repository;
import org.openrdf.repository.sail.SailRepository;
import org.openrdf.sail.memory.MemoryStore;
import org.openrdf.sail.inferencer.fc.ForwardChainingRDFSInferencer;

...

Repository myRepository = new SailRepository(
                          new ForwardChainingRDFSInferencer(
                          new MemoryStore()));
myRepository.initialize();]]></programlisting>
			<para>
				Each layer in the Sail stack is created by a constructor
				that takes the underlying Sail as a parameter. Finally, we
				create the <classname>SailRepository</classname> object as a
				functional wrapper around the Sail stack.
			</para>
			<para>
				The <classname>ForwardChainingRDFSInferencer</classname> that is
				used in this example is a generic RDF Schema inferencer; it can
				be used on top of any Sail that supports the methods it
				requires. Both <classname>MemoryStore</classname> and 
				<classname>NativeStore</classname> support these methods.
			</para>
		</section> <!-- Creating a repository with RDF Schema inferencing -->

		<section>
			<title>Accessing a remote repository</title>
			<para>
				Working with remote repositories is just as easy as working
				with local ones. We can simply use a different
				<classname>Repository</classname> object, the
				<classname>HTTPRepository</classname>, instead of the
				<classname>SailRepository</classname> class.
			</para>
			<para>
				A requirement is of course that there is a Sesame 2 server
				running on some remote system, which is accessible over HTTP.
				For example, suppose that at
				<filename>http://example.org/sesame2/</filename> a
				Sesame server is running, which has a repository with the
				identification 'example-db'. We can access this repository in
				our code as follows:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[
import org.openrdf.repository.Repository;
import org.openrdf.repository.http.HTTPRepository;

...

String sesameServer = "http://example.org/sesame2";
String repositoryID = "example-db";

Repository myRepository = new HTTPRepository(sesameServer, repositoryID);
myRepository.initialize();]]></programlisting>
		</section> <!-- Accessing a remote repository -->
	</section> <!-- Creating a Repository object -->

	<section>
		<title>Using a repository: RepositoryConnections</title>
		<para>
			Now that we have created a <classname>Repository</classname>, we
			want to do something with it. In Sesame 2, this is achieved through
			the use of <classname>RepositoryConnection</classname> objects, which
			can be created by the <classname>Repository</classname>.
		</para>
		<para>
			A <classname>RepositoryConnection</classname> represents - as the name
			suggests - a connection to the actual store. We can issue operations
			over this connection, and close it when we are done to make sure we
			are not keeping resources unnnecessarily occupied.
		</para>
		<para>
			In the following sections, we will show some examples of basic
			operations.
		</para>
		<section>
			<title>Adding RDF to a repository</title>
			<para>
				The Repository API offers various methods for adding data to a
				repository. Data can be added by specifying the location of a file
				that contains RDF data, and statements can be added individually or in
				collections.
			</para>
			<para>
				We perform operations on a repository by requesting a
				<classname>RepositoryConnection</classname> from the repository. On this
				<classname>RepositoryConnection</classname> object we can the various
				operations, such as query evaluation, getting, adding, or
				removing statements, etc.
			</para>
			<para>
				The following example code adds two files, one local and one
				available through HTTP, to a repository:
				</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[

		<section>
			<title>Querying a repository</title>
			<para>
				The Repository API has a number of methods for creating and
				evaluating queries. Three types of queries are distinguished:
				tuple queries, graph queries and boolean queries. The query
				types differ in the type of results that they produce.
			</para>
			<para>
				The result of a tuple query is a set of tuples (or variable
				bindings), where each tuple represents a solution of a query.
				This type of query is commonly used to get specific values (URIs,
				blank nodes, literals) from the stored RDF data.
			</para>
			<para>
				The result of graph queries is an RDF graph (or set of statements).
				This type of query is very useful for extracting sub-graphs from
				the stored RDF data, which can then be queried further, serialized
				to an RDF document, etc.
			</para>
			<para>
				The result of boolean queries is a simple boolean value, i.e.
				<parameter>true</parameter> of <parameter>false</parameter>.
				This type of query can be used to check if a repository contains
				specific information.
			</para>
			<para>
				<emphasis>Note:</emphasis> Sesame 2 currently supports two query
				languages: SeRQL and SPARQL. The former is explained in
				<xref linkend="chapter-serql"/>, the specification for the latter is
				available
				<ulink url="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/">online</ulink>.
			</para>

			<section>
				<title>Evaluating a tuple query</title>
				<para>
					To evaluate a tuple query we simply do the following:
				</para>
				<programlisting><![CDATA[
import java.util.List;
import org.openrdf.OpenRDFException;
import org.openrdf.repository.RepositoryConnection;
import org.openrdf.query.TupleQuery;
import org.openrdf.query.TupleQueryResult;
import org.openrdf.query.BindingSet;
import org.openrdf.query.QueryLanguage;

...

try {
   RepositoryConnection con = myRepository.getConnection();
   try {
      String queryString = "SELECT x, y FROM {x} p {y}";
      TupleQuery tupleQuery = con.prepareTupleQuery(QueryLanguage.SERQL, queryString);
      TupleQueryResult result = tupleQuery.evaluate();
      try {
         .... // do something with the result
      }
      finally {
         result.close();
      }
   }
   finally {
      con.close();
   }
}
catch (OpenRDFException e) {
   // handle exception
}]]></programlisting>
				<para>
					This evaluates a SeRQL query and returns a
					<classname>TupleQueryResult</classname>, which consists of a
					sequence of <classname>BindingSet</classname> objects. Each
					<classname>BindingSet</classname> contains a set of
					<classname>Binding</classname> objects. A binding is pair
					relating a name (as used in the query's SELECT clause) with
					a value.
				</para>
				<para>
					We can use the <classname>TupleQueryResult</classname> to iterate
					over all results and get each individual result for
					<varname>x</varname> and <varname>y</varname>:
				</para>
				<programlisting><![CDATA[
while (result.hasNext()) {
   BindingSet bindingSet = result.next();
   Value valueOfX = bindingSet.getValue("x");
   Value valueOfY = bindingSet.getValue("y");

   // do something interesting with the values here...
}]]></programlisting>

				<para>
					As you can see, we retrieve values by name rather than by an
					index. The names used should be the names of variables as
					specified in your query. The
					<classname>TupleQueryResult.getBindingNames()</classname> method
					returns a list of binding names, in the order in which they were
					specified in the query. To process the bindings in each binding
					set in the order specified by the projection, you can do the
					following:
				</para>
				<programlisting><![CDATA[
List<String> bindingNames = result.getBindingNames();
while (result.hasNext()) {
   BindingSet bindingSet = result.next();
   Value firstValue = bindingSet.getValue(bindingNames.get(0));
   Value secondValue = bindingSet.getValue(bindingNames.get(1));

   // do something interesting with the values here...
}]]></programlisting>
				<para>
					It is important to invoke the <function>close()</function>
					operation on the <classname>TupleQueryResult</classname>,
					after we are done with it. A
					<classname>TupleQueryResult</classname> evaluates lazily and
					keeps resources (such as connections to the underlying
					database) open. Closing the
					<classname>TupleQueryResult</classname> frees up these
					resources. Do not forget that iterating over a result may
					cause exceptions! The best way to make sure no connections are
					kept open unnecessarily is to invoke
					<function>close()</function> in the
					<classname>finally</classname> clause.
				</para>
				<para>
					An alternative to producing a
					<classname>TupleQueryResult</classname> is to supply an object
					that implements the
					<classname>TupleQueryResultHandler</classname> interface to
					the query's <function>evaluate()</function> method. The main
					difference is that when using a return object, the caller has
					control over when the next answer is retrieved, whereas with
					the use of a handler, the connection simply pushes answers to
					the handler object as soon as it has them available.
				</para>
				<para>
					As an example we will use
					<classname>SPARQLResultsXMLWriter</classname>, which is a
					<classname>TupleQueryResultHandler</classname> implementation that writes
					SPARQL Results XML documents to an output stream or to a writer:
				</para>
				<programlisting><![CDATA[
import org.openrdf.query.resultio.sparqlxml.SPARQLResultsXMLWriter;

...

FileOutputStream out = new FileOutputStream("/path/to/result.srx");
try {
   SPARQLResultsXMLWriter sparqlWriter = new SPARQLResultsXMLWriter(out);

   RepositoryConnection con = myRepository.getConnection();
   try {
      String queryString = "SELECT * FROM {x} p {y}";
      TupleQuery tupleQuery = con.prepareTupleQuery(QueryLanguage.SERQL, queryString);
      tupleQuery.evaluate(sparqlWriter);
   }
   finally {
      con.close();
   }
}
finally {
   out.close();
}]]></programlisting>
				<para>
					You can just as easily supply your own application-specific
					implementation of <classname>TupleQueryResultHandler</classname> though.
				</para>
				<para>
					Lastly, an important warning: as soon as you are done with the
					<classname>RepositoryConnection</classname> object, you should close it.
					Notice that during processing of the
					<classname>TupleQueryResult</classname> object (for example,
					when iterating over its contents), the
					<classname>RepositoryConnection</classname> should still be open. We can
					invoke <function>con.close()</function> after we have finished
					with the result.
				</para>
			</section> <!-- Evaluating a tuple query -->

			<section>
				<title>Evaluating a graph query</title>
				<para>
					The following code evaluates a graph query on a repository:
				</para>
				<programlisting><![CDATA[
import org.openrdf.query.GraphQueryResult;

GraphQueryResult graphResult = con.prepareGraphQuery(
      QueryLanguage.SERQL, "CONSTRUCT * FROM {x} p {y}").evaluate();]]></programlisting>
				<para>
					A <classname>GraphQueryResult</classname> is similar to
					<classname>TupleQueryResult</classname> in that is an object
					that iterates over the query results. However, for graph queries
					the query results are RDF statements, so a
					<classname>GraphQueryResult</classname> iterates over
					<classname>Statement</classname> objects:
				<programlisting><![CDATA[
while (graphResult.hasNext()) {
   Statement st = graphResult.next();
   // ... do something with the resulting statement here.
}]]></programlisting>

				<para>
					The <classname>TupleQueryResultHandler</classname> equivalent
					for graph queries is
					<classname>org.openrdf.rio.RDFHandler</classname>. Again, this
					is a generic interface, each object implementing it can
					process the reported RDF statements in any way it wants.
				</para>
				<para>
					All writers from Rio (such as the <classname>RDFXMLWriter</classname>,
					<classname>TurtleWriter</classname>, <classname>TriXWriter</classname>,
					etc.) implement the <classname>RDFHandler</classname> interface. This
					allows them to be used in combination with querying quite easily. In the
					following example, we use a <classname>TurtleWriter</classname>
					to write the result of a SeRQL graph query to standard output
					in Turtle format:
				</para>
				<programlisting><![CDATA[
import org.openrdf.rio.turtle.TurtleWriter;

...

RepositoryConnection con = myRepository.getConnection();
try {
   TurtleWriter turtleWriter = new TurtleWriter(System.out);

   con.prepareGraphQuery(QueryLanguage.SERQL,
         "CONSTRUCT * FROM {x} p {y}").evaluate(turtleWriter);
}
finally {
   con.close();
}]]></programlisting>
				<para>
					Again, note that as soon as we are done with the result of the query
					(either after iterating over the contents of the
					<classname>GraphQueryResult</classname> or after invoking the
					<classname>RDFHandler</classname>), we invoke
					<function>con.close()</function> to close the connection and free
					resources.
				</para>
				</para>
			</section> <!-- Evaluating a graph query -->
			<section>
				<title>Preparing and Reusing Queries</title>
				<para>
					In the previous sections we have simply created a query from a
					string and immediately evaluated it. However, the
					<function>prepareTupleQuery</function> and
					<function>prepareGraphQuery</function> methods return objects of
					type <classname>Query</classname>, specifically
					<classname>TupleQuery</classname> and
					<classname>GraphQuery</classname>.
				</para>
				<para>
					A <classname>Query</classname> object, once created, can be
					(re)used. For example, we can evaluate a
					<classname>Query</classname> object, then add some data to
					our repository, and evaluate the same query again.
				</para>
				<para>
					The <classname>Query</classname> object also has a
					<function>setBinding</function> method, which can be used to
					specify specific values for query variables. As a simple
					example, suppose we have a repository containing names and
					e-mail addresses of people, and we want to do a query for each
					person, retrieve his/her e-mail address, for example, but we
					want to do a separate query for each person. This can be
					achieved using the <function>setBinding</function>
					functionality, as follows:
				</para>
				<programlisting><![CDATA[
RepositoryConnection con = myRepository.getConnection();

try {
   // First, prepare a query that retrieves all names of persons

   // Then, prepare another query that retrieves all e-mail addresses of persons:
   TupleQuery mailQuery = con.prepareTupleQuery(QueryLanguage.SERQL,
         "SELECT mail FROM {person} ex:mail {mail}; ex:name {name}");

   // Evaluate the first query to get all names
   TupleQueryResult nameResult = nameQuery.evaluate();
   try {
      // Loop over all names, and retrieve the corresponding e-mail address.
      while (nameResult.hasNext()) {
         BindingSet bindingSet = nameResult.next();
         Value name = bindingSet.get("name");

         // Retrieve the matching mailbox, by setting the binding for
         // the variable 'name' to the retrieved value:
         mailQuery.setBinding("name", name);

         TupleQueryResult mailResult = mailQuery.evaluate();

         // mailResult now contains the e-mail addresses for one particular person
         try {
            ....

         finally {
            // after we are done, close the result

   }
   finally {
      nameResult.close();
   }
}
finally {
   con.close();
}]]></programlisting>
				<para>
					The values with which you perform the
					<function>setBinding</function> operation of course do not
					necessarily have to come from a previous query result (as they do
					in the above example). Using a <classname>ValueFactory</classname>
					you can create your own value objects. You can use this
					functionality to, for example, query for a particular keyword
					that is given by user input:
				</para>
				<programlisting><![CDATA[

// We prepare a query that retrieves all documents for a keyword.
// Notice that in this query the 'keyword' variable is not bound to
// any specific value yet.
TupleQuery keywordQuery = con.prepareTupleQuery(QueryLanguage.SERQL,
      "SELECT document FROM {document} ex:keyword {keyword}");

// Then we set the binding to a literal representation of our keyword.
// Evaluation of the query object will now effectively be the same as
// if we had specified the query as follows:
//   SELECT document FROM {document} ex:keyword {"foobar"}
keywordQuery.setBinding("keyword", factory.createLiteral(keyword));

// We then evaluate the prepared query and can process the result:

				The <classname>RepositoryConnection</classname> can also be used
				for adding, retrieving, removing or otherwise manipulating

			</para>
			<para>
				To be able to add new statements, we can use a

			<para>
				Of course, it will not always be necessary to use a
				<classname>ValueFactory</classname> to create URIs. In practice,
				you will find that you quite often retrieve existing URIs from the
				repository (for example, by evaluating a query) and then use those
				values to add new statements.
			</para>
			<para>
				As you can see in the above code, for the default RDF and RDF Schema
				properties (such as 'rdf:type' and 'rdfs:subClassOf') it is not
				necessary to create new <classname>URI</classname> objects. Instead,
				you can import the vocabulary classes
				<classname>org.openrdf.model.vocabulary.RDF</classname> and
				<classname>RDFS</classname> which provide you static references to
				the vocabulary primitives.
			</para>
			<para>
				Retrieving statements works in a very similar way. One way of
				retrieving statements we have already seen actually: we can get a
				<classname>GraphQueryResult</classname> containing statements by
				evaluating a graph query.
				However, we can also use direct method calls to retrieve (sets of)
				statements. For example, to retrieve all statements about
				Alice, we could do:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[
RepositoryResult<Statement> statements = con.getStatements(alice, null, null, true);]]></programlisting>
			<para>
				The additional boolean parameter at the end (set to 'true' in this
				example) indicates whether inferred triples should be included in the
				result. Of course, this parameter only makes a difference if your
				repository uses an inferencer.
			</para>
			<para>
				The <classname>RepositoryResult</classname> is an iterator-like
				object that lazily retrieves each matching statement from the
				repository when its <function>next()</function> method is called.
				Note that, like is the case with
				<classname>QueryResult</classname> objects, iterating over a
				<classname>RepositoryResult</classname> may result in exceptions
				which you should catch to make sure that the
				<classname>RepositoryResult</classname> is always properly closed
				after use:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[
RepositoryResult<Statement> statements = con.getStatements(alice, null, null, true);

try {
   while (statements.hasNext()) {
      Statement st = statements.next();

      ... // do something with the statement
   }
}
finally {
   statements.close(); // make sure the result object is closed properly
}]]></programlisting>
			<para>
				In the above method invocation, we see four parameters being
				passed. The first three represent the subject, predicate and object
				of the RDF statements which should be retrieved. A
				<classname>null</classname> value indicates a wildcard, so the
				above method call retrieves all statements which have as their
				subject Alice, and have any kind of predicate and object. The
				fourth parameter indicates whether or not inferred statements
				should be included or not.
			</para>
			<para>
				Removing statements again works in a very similar fashion. Suppose
				we want to retract the statement that the name of Alice is
				"Alice"):
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[
con.remove(alice, name, alicesName);]]></programlisting>
			<para>
				Or, if we want to erase all statements about Alice completely, we
				can do:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[
con.remove(alice, null, null);]]></programlisting>
		</section>

		<section>
			<title>Working with Collections and Iterations</title>
			<para>
				Most of these examples have been on the level of individual
				statements. However, the Repository API offers several methods
				that work with <classname>Collection</classname>s of statements,
				allowing more batch-like update operations.
			</para>
			<para>
				For example, in the following bit of code, we first retrieve all
				statements about Alice, put them in a
				<classname>Collection</classname> and then remove them:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[
import info.aduna.iteration.Iterations;

// Retrieve all statements about Alice and put them in a list
RepositoryResult<Statement> statements = con.getStatements(alice, null, null, true));
List<Statement> aboutAlice = Iterations.addAll(statements, new ArrayList<Statement>());

// Then, remove them from the repository
con.remove(aboutAlice);]]></programlisting>
			<para>
				As you can see, the
				<classname>info.aduna.iteration.Iterations</classname>
				class provides a convenient method that takes an
				<classname>Iteration</classname> (of which
				<classname>RepositoryResult</classname> is a subclass) and a
				Collection as input, and returns the Collection with the contents
				of the iterator added to it. It also automatically closes the
				Iteration for you.
			</para>
			<para>
				In the above code, you first retrieve all statements, put them in
				a list, and then remove them. Although this works fine, it can be
				done in an easier fashion, by simply supplying the resulting
				object directly:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[
con.remove(con.getStatements(alice, null, null, true));]]></programlisting>
			<para>
				The <classname>RepositoryConnection</classname> interface has several variations of
				add, retrieve and remove operations. See the Javadoc API
				documentation for a full overview of the options.
			</para>
		</section>

		<section>
			<title>Using context</title>
			<para>
				Sesame 2 supports the notion of <emphasis>context</emphasis>, which
				you can think of as a way to group sets of statements together
				through a single group identifier (this identifier can be a blank
				node or a URI).
			</para>
			<para>
				A very typical way to use context is tracking
				<emphasis>provenance</emphasis> of the statements in a repository,
				that is, which file these statements originate from. For example,
				consider an application where you add RDF data from different files
				to a repository, and then one of those files is updated. You would
				then like to replace the data from that single file in the
				repository, and to be able to do this you need a way to figure out
				which statements need to be removed. The context mechanism gives you
				a way to do that.
			</para>
			<para>
				In the following example, we add an RDF document from the Web to our
				repository, in a context. In the example, we make the context
				identifier equal to the Web location of the file being uploaded.
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[
String location = "http://example.org/example/example.rdf";
String baseURI = location;
URL url = new URL(location);
URI context = f.createURI(location);

con.add(url, baseURI, RDFFormat.RDFXML, context);]]></programlisting>
			<para>
				We can now use the context mechanism to specifically address these
				statements in the repository for retrieve and remove operations:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[
// Get all statements in the context
RepositoryResult<Statement> result = con.getStatements(null, null, null, true, context);

try {
   while (result.hasNext()) {
      Statement st = result.next();
      ... // do something interesting with the result
   }
}
finally {
   result.close();
}

// Export all statements in the context to System.out, in RDF/XML format
RDFHandler rdfxmlWriter = new RDFXMLWriter(System.out);
con.export(context, rdfxmlWriter);

// Remove all statements in the context from the repository
con.clear(context);]]></programlisting>
			<para>
				In most methods in the Repository API, the context parameter is a
				<emphasis>vararg</emphasis>, meaning that you can specify an
				arbitrary number (zero, one, or more) of context identifiers. This
				way, you can combine different contexts together. For example, we
				can very easily retrieve statements that appear in either 'context1'
				or 'context2'.
			</para>
			<para>
				In the following example we add information about Bob and Alice
				again, but this time each has their own context. We also create a
				new property called 'creator' that has as its value the name of the
				person who is the creator a particular context. The knowledge about
				creators of contexts we do not add to any particular context,
				however:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[
URI context1 = f.createURI("http://example.org/context1");
URI context2 = f.createURI("http://example.org/context2");
URI creator = f.createURI("http://example.org/ontology/creator");

// Add stuff about Alice to context1
con.add(alice, RDF.TYPE, person, context1);
con.add(alice, name, alicesName, context1);

// Alice is the creator of context1
con.add(context1, creator, alicesName);

// Add stuff about Bob to context2
con.add(bob, RDF.TYPE, person, context2);
con.add(bob, name, bobsName, context2);

// Bob is the creator of context2
con.add(context2, creator, bobsName);]]></programlisting>
			<para>
				Once we have this information in our repository, we can retrieve all
				statements about either Alice or Bob by using the context vararg:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[
// Get all statements in either context1 or context2
RepositoryResult<Statement> result =
      con.getStatements(null, null, null, true, context1, context2);]]></programlisting>
			<para>
				You should observe that the above RepositoryResult will not contain the
				information that context1 was created by Alice and context2 by Bob. This
				is because those statements were added without any context, thus they do
				not appear in context1 or context2, themselves.
			</para>
			<para>
				To explicitly retrieve statements that do not have an associated
				context, we do the following:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[
// Get all statements that do not have an associated context
RepositoryResult<Statement> result =
      con.getStatements(null, null, null, true, (Resource)null);]]></programlisting>
			<para>
				This will give us <emphasis>only</emphasis> the statements about the
				creators of the contexts, because those are the only statements that do
				not have an associated context. Note that we have to explicitly cast the
				null argument to <classname>Resource</classname>, because otherwise it
				is ambiguous whether we are specifying a single value or an entire array
				that is null (a vararg is internally treated as an array). Simply
				invoking <function>getStatements(s, p, o, true, null)</function> without
				an explicit cast will result in an <classname>IllegalArgumentException</classname>.
			</para>
			<para>
				We can also get everything that either has no context or is in context1:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[
// Get all statements that do not have an associated context, or that are in context1
RepositoryResult<Statement> result =
      con.getStatements(null, null, null, true, (Resource)null, context1);]]></programlisting>
			<para>
				So as you can see, you can freely combine contexts in this fashion.
			</para>
			<para>
				<emphasis>Important:</emphasis>
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[getStatements(null, null, null, true);]]></programlisting>
			<para>
				is not the same as:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[getStatements(null, null, null, true, (Resource)null);]]></programlisting>
			<para>
				The former (without any context id parameter) retrieves all statements
				in the repository, ignoring any context information. The latter,
				however, only retrieves statements that explicitly do not have
				any associated context.
			</para>
		</section> <!-- using context -->

		<section id="section-transactions">
			<title>Transactions</title>
			<para>
				So far, we have shown individual operations on repositories:
				adding statements, removing them, etc. By default, a
				<classname>RepositoryConnection</classname>
				runs in <emphasis>autoCommit</emphasis> mode, meaning that each
				operation on a <classname>RepositoryConnection</classname> is immediately sent
				to the store and committed.
			</para>
			<para>
				The <classname>RepositoryConnection</classname> interface supports a full
				transactional mechanism that allows one to group modification
				operations together and treat them as a single update: before the
				transaction is committed, none of the operations in the transaction
				has taken effect, and after, they all take effect. If something goes
				wrong at any point during a transaction, it can be
				<emphasis>rolled back</emphasis> so that the state of the repository
				is the same as before the transaction started. Bundling update
				operations in a single transaction often also improves update
				performance compared to multiple smaller transactions.
			</para>
			<para>
				We can achieve this behaviour by switching off the
				<classname>RepositoryConnection</classname>'s autoCommit mode. In
				the following example, we use a non-autocommit connection to
				bundle two file addition operations in a single transaction:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[
File inputFile1 = new File("/path/to/example1.rdf");
String baseURI1 = "http://example.org/example1/";

File inputFile2 = new File("/path/to/example2.rdf");
String baseURI2 = "http://example.org/example2/";

RepositoryConnection con = myRepository.getConnection();
try {
   con.setAutoCommit(false);

   // Add the first file
   con.add(inputFile1, baseURI1, RDFFormat.RDFXML);

   // Add the second file
   con.add(inputFile2, baseURI2, RDFFormat.RDFXML);

   // If everything went as planned, we can commit the result
   con.commit();
}
catch (RepositoryException e) {
   // Something went wrong during the transaction, so we roll it back
   con.rollback();
}
finally {
   // Whatever happens, we want to close the connection when we are done.
   con.close();
}]]></programlisting>
			<para>
				In the above example, we use a transaction to add two files to the
				repository. Only if both files can be successfully added will the
				repository change. If one of the files can not be added (for example
				because it can not be read), then the entire transaction is
				cancelled and none of the files is added to the repository.
