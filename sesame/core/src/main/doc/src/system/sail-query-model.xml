		The class diagram above shows the Sail Query model from package
			<ulink url="../api/org/openrdf/sesame/sail/query/package-summary.html">
			org.openrdf.sesame.sail.query</ulink>.
		The Sail Query Model is a generic model for RDF queries. Queries in
		various languages (SeRQL, RDQL, ...) are parsed to models built from
		these classes. Objects of type Query can be handed over to Sail objects
		for evaluation.

	<para>
		Sails are free to evaluate query models in a way that suits them best; a
		Sail that operates on a powerful relational database supporting SQL, for
		example, can translate (parts of) the query model to SQL queries. The
		query model is also able to evaluate itself: The TripleSource interface
		defines all methods that are needed by the query model to do this. By
		implementing this interface, a Sail can use the self-evaluating feature.
		The heuristics-based QueryOptimizer can be used to apply some general
		optimizations to query models, resulting in lower evaluation times.
