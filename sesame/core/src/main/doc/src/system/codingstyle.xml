		The following guide lines are used for the Java source code of Sesame:
	</para>
	<itemizedlist>
		<listitem>Tabs are used for indentation</listitem>
		<listitem>Code doesn't extend further than column 110</listitem>
		<listitem>Comments do not extend further than column 80</listitem>
		<listitem>Classes, methods, variables, etc. are as private as
			possible (but not to the level where it gets inconvenient). So,
			variables that are only accessed by the class they're defined in are
			private, methods used by subclasses are protected, etc. This keeps
			the APIs as clear and minimal as possible, making it easier to
			restructure a class internally. Making classes, methods, etc. more
			public is safe and easy, the reverse is hard and potentially breaks
			backwards compatibility.</listitem>
		<listitem>Class names start with an upper case letter (e.g.:
			MyClassName), method- and variable names start with a lower case
			letter (e.g. _name and getName()).</listitem>
		<listitem>Class-, method- and variable names that consist of more than
			one word capitalize the first letter of each word, for example:
			MyClassName, myMethod() and _myVariable. Words that are actually
			abbreviations of names appear as-is, e.g.: XMLUtil, RDFParser and
			SeRQLEngine.</listitem>
		<listitem>Names of constants (final variables) are in all-uppercase
			letters.</listitem>
		<listitem>All source files start with a comment containing the standard
			BSD-header and mentions the appropriate copyright holder(s).</listitem>
