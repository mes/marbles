/**
 * Main interface for updating data in and performing queries on a Sesame
 * repository. By default, a RepositoryConnection is in autoCommit mode, meaning
 * that each operation corresponds to a single transaction on the underlying
 * store. autoCommit can be switched off in which case it is up to the user to
 * handle transaction commit/rollback. Note that care should be taking to always
 * properly close a RepositoryConnection after one is finished with it, to free
 * up resources and avoid unnecessary locks.
 * <p>
 * Several methods take a vararg argument that optionally specifies a (set of)
 * context(s) on which the method should operate. Note that a vararg parameter
 * is optional, it can be completely left out of the method call, in which case
 * a method either operates on a provided statements context (if one of the
 * method parameters is a statement or collection of statements), or operates on
 * the repository as a whole, completely ignoring context. A vararg argument may
 * also be 'null' (cast to Resource) meaning that the method operates on those
 * statements which have no associated context only.
 * <p>
 * Examples:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * // Ex 1: this method retrieves all statements that appear in either context1 or context2, or both.
 * RepositoryConnection.getStatements(null, null, null, true, context1, context2);
 * 
 * // Ex 2: this method retrieves all statements that appear in the repository (regardless of context).
 * RepositoryConnection.getStatements(null, null, null, true);
 * 
 * // Ex 3: this method retrieves all statements that have no associated context in the repository.
 * // Observe that this is not equivalent to the previous method call.
 * RepositoryConnection.getStatements(null, null, null, true, (Resource)null);
 * 
 * // Ex 4: this method adds a statement to the store. If the statement object itself has 
 * // a context (i.e. statement.getContext() != null) the statement is added to that context. Otherwise,
 * // it is added without any associated context.
 * RepositoryConnection.add(statement);
 * 
 * // Ex 5: this method adds a statement to context1 in the store. It completely ignores any
 * // context the statement itself has.
 * RepositoryConnection.add(statement, context1);
 * </pre>
